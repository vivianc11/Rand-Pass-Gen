# Rand-Pass-Gen

## About the Project
This is a random password generator that gives randomly generates characters to be used. The user is given an option to pick certain password criteria prior to generating the password. Such critera are: capital letters, numbers, symbols, and number of characters from 8-128.

## Building the Generator
There was starter code from Xandromus on github: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet

I've added code to JavaScript to make the generator functional while meeting these requirements:

- Clicking on the button should genereate a series of prompts for password criteria

- The user can select which criteria to include in the password including: capital letters, numbers, symbols, and the number of characters.

- User input is validated when choosing criteria so that only valid inputs are being used.

- Password is generated and is displayed on the page

### Control Flow Statements Used
- Functions to execute generating a random password and displaying the password on page
- While loops to validate user input
- If else statements to include individual password criteria into one variable for storage
- For loops to create a random number generator for the index of the string containing all the activated password criteria
